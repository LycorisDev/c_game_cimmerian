# Cimmerian

*Cimmerian* is a pseudo-3D game written in C89 and similar to the likes of Wolfenstein 3D.  

The libraries used are:
- naturally the C standard library,
- OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) for the graphics,
- GLFW (OpenGL Framework) for the windowing (= GUI & input handling),
- GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library) to use the latest OpenGL version available on the machine,
- and OpenAL (Open Audio Library) for the audio.
