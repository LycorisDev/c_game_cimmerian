- Have them cubes be cubes no matter the aspect ratio.

- I would like to have a 1D array, for which I do map[y * width + x] to access 
the proper cell, instead of map[y][x]. My map init function handles this kind 
of array, so I don't want to have to malloc each line, one allocation and we 
call it a day.

- Fix the "bypass player size if moving on both axis at the same time and 
insisting like crazy as if trying to break the game". The player won't phase 
through walls, but it looks a tad weird.
