- Fix sprite not showing through doors.
- The goal is to reach a tall monolith. It can cycle through different colors 
or even have an animated texture.
- Use a colored glass or something to showcase transparency. Maybe an enemy.
- Center the door in the middle of the cell.
- Certain transparent cells can show their backfaces too (e.g. door without 
walls).

- Minimap.
- Animated sprite.
- Rotate with the mouse.

- Sound.
- Enter a seed to generate a level, or maybe you can send a map file. Support 
for both?
- Main menu.
