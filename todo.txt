Diffs between the GL and MLX versions:
- The MLX version doesn't have fullscreen mode, only a bigger window size.
- The MLX version has a slower mouse-based rotation.

[DEFAULT MAP]

NSEW: Player start position
D: Door (simple door)
G: Goal (victory)
P: Portal (to another map)
0: Ground
1-9: Type of ordinary walls
Whitespace: Empty space

[CEIL-FLOOR MAP]

0-9: Pair of ceiling and floor textures (null is possible)
Whitespace: Null for sure

[PORTAL DETAIL]

P N X, Y path_to_dest_map
P N X, Y path_to_dest_map N X, Y

-> First cardinal: the face of the cell used as portal.
-> First XY (int): the location of the portal cell in the current map.
-> String: the file path to the destination map (can be current).
	If the name is literally "null", this leads to a dummy map meant to trigger 
	a game over.
-> [Optional] The destination's cardinal direction + new pos XY (int).
The new pos can be the location of another portal, it's safe.
If not indicated, the map's default start pos and direction will be used.

PROBLEMS THAT ARE NOT IMPORTANT

- For some reason, the FPS drops dramatically if a greater resolution is used, 
even if it's still 16/9. Can you figure out why?
