Diffs between the GL and MLX versions:
- The MLX version doesn't have fullscreen mode, only a bigger window size.
- The MLX version has a slower mouse-based rotation.

Notes:
- The minimum window size is 128x128 while the maximum is the monitor size.
- Use a value inferior or equal to 0.1 as the aspect ratio to express "whatever 
the monitor's aspect ratio is". For example 0 or -1.

[DEFAULT MAP]

NSEW: Player start position
D: Door (simple door)
G: Goal (victory)
P: Portal (to another map)
0: Ground
1-9: Type of ordinary walls
Whitespace: Empty space

[CEIL-FLOOR MAP]

0-9: Pair of ceiling and floor textures (null is possible)
Whitespace: Null for sure

[PORTAL DETAIL]

P N X, Y path_to_dest_map
P N X, Y path_to_dest_map N X, Y

-> First cardinal: the face of the cell used as portal.
-> First XY (int): the location of the portal cell in the current map.
-> String: the file path to the destination map (can be current).
	If the name is literally "null", this leads to a dummy map meant to trigger 
	a game over.
-> [Optional] The destination's cardinal direction + new pos XY (int).
The new pos can be the location of another portal, it's safe.
If not indicated, the map's default start pos and direction will be used.

PROBLEM: RESOLUTION GREATER THAN 640x360

-> MLX Lib: Why does hiding the cursor cause a leak? Once fixed, hide the 
cursor to be like the GL version.
-> MLX Lib: Consider modifying the MLX to hide the window decoration in 
fullscreen. If this works, make a real fullscreen.
-> MLX Lib: Resize window?
-> GL: Focus seems to be lost when toggling off fullscreen. Fix pls.
-> Understand why there's a dramatic FPS drop in both versions with a x2 or x3 
resolution (x1 is 640x360). Is it just because more rays are being casted?

	* Make sure the GUI is good in the following aspect ratios: 1:1, 3:2, 4:3, 
	10:9 and 16:9.
	* Need to adapt the font size, the icon size and the cursor size, then GUI 
	is done.
	* Need to adapt background/skybox. Consider generating the skybox, and 
	maybe it's the opportunity to have a proper one, with like mountains and 
	stuff remaining where they should in the world.
