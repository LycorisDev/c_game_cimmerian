Diffs between the GL and MLX versions:
- The MLX version doesn't have fullscreen mode, only a bigger window size.
- The MLX version has a slower mouse-based rotation.

[DEFAULT MAP]

NSEW: Player start position
D: Door (simple door)
G: Goal (victory)
P: Portal (to another map)
0: Ground
1-9: Type of ordinary walls
Whitespace: Empty space

[CEIL-FLOOR MAP]

0-9: Pair of ceiling and floor textures (null is possible)
Whitespace: Null for sure

[PORTAL DETAIL]

P N X, Y path_to_dest_map
P N X, Y path_to_dest_map N X, Y

-> First cardinal: the face of the cell used as portal.
-> First XY (int): the location of the portal cell in the current map.
-> String: the file path to the destination map (can be current).
	If the name is literally "null", this leads to a dummy map meant to trigger 
	a game over.
-> [Optional] The destination's cardinal direction + new pos XY (int).
The new pos can be the location of another portal, it's safe.
If not indicated, the map's default start pos and direction will be used.

PROBLEM: RESOLUTION GREATER THAN 640x360

- For some reason, in both versions, the FPS drops dramatically if the 
resolution is greater than 640x360. Allow a greater resolution (x2 and x3), 
still in 16/9. Also, for the MLX, make sure that the "viewport" is centered 
instead of starting at the window's origin.
	* The minimap is almost fixed. The MLX version is done, but the GL version 
	runs into issues in x2 (perfect in x1 and x3). Why? The minimap has the 
	same values in both versions in x2, and yet the GL version appears small 
	and centered instead of anchored to the top right corner. It must have 
	something to do with the fact that the GL version has a frame whose real 
	size is the monitor's size, whereas the resolution can be smaller, but the 
	MLX version's frame size and real size are equal. It's just how GL works, I 
	have to do this.
	* Need to adapt the font size, the icon size and the cursor size, then GUI 
	is done.
	* Need to adapt background/skybox.
