Diffs between the GL and MLX versions:
- The MLX version doesn't have fullscreen mode, only a bigger window size.
- The MLX version has a slower mouse-based rotation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DEFAULT MAP]

NSEW: Player start position
D: Door (simple door)
G: Goal (victory)
P: Portal (to another map)
0: Ground
1-9: Type of ordinary walls
Whitespace: Empty space

[CEIL-FLOOR MAP]

0-9: Pair of ceiling and floor textures (null is possible)
Whitespace: Null for sure

[PORTAL DETAIL]

P N X, Y path_to_dest_map
P N X, Y path_to_dest_map N X, Y

-> First cardinal: the face of the cell used as portal.
-> First XY (int): the location of the portal cell in the current map.
-> String: the file path to the destination map (can be current).
	If the name is literally "null", this leads to a dummy map meant to trigger 
	a game over.
-> [Optional] The destination's cardinal direction + new pos XY (int).
The new pos can be the location of another portal, it's safe.
If not indicated, the map's default start pos and direction will be used.

PROBLEM: RESOLUTION GREATER THAN 640x360

-> MLX: In size x2, the frame size is numerically updated and yet is drawn with 
a thickness of 1 pixel per point.
-> MLX: The viewport is centered on the X and Y axis. Check that the cursor 
matches that (it needs to communicate a position in `man->res.res` scale).
-> Understand why there's a dramatic FPS drop in both versions with a x2 or x3 
resolution (x1 is 640x360).
-> Consider modifying the MLX to hide the window decoration in fullscreen. If 
this works, make a real fullscreen.

	* Need to adapt the font size, the icon size and the cursor size, then GUI 
	is done.
	* Need to adapt background/skybox. Consider generating the skybox, and 
	maybe it's the opportunity to have a proper one, with like mountains and 
	stuff remaining where they should in the world.
