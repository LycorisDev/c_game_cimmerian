ANIMATED TEXTURE

- For each sprite frame:
	average_color
	is_see_through (we need this for the door and portal)

- The portal texture is a placeholder. Use an actual portal texture, but with 
an alpha of 0.75 and not 1.0.

---

ANIMATED SKYBOX

- For the map's skybox and background, use t_spr instead of t_img so that we 
can have an animated background.

Norm:
src/door.c
src/main.c
src/maps.c
src/graphics/raycasting/ceiling.c
src/graphics/raycasting/floor.c
src/graphics/raycasting/objects.c

- Enter the portal and see from within + Fade out effect + Fade in effect to 
another map or a victory message.

- Collision with a decor sprite.
- Collectible sprite.

- Pathfinding for an enemy sprite.
- The enemy is displayed on the minimap.
- The enemy is visible beyond the dark veil.

- Sound.
- Main menu, at least for sound options (silence / volume).

- Load a level from a file. Maybe something like Grim Fetcher, with a folder 
containing numbered levels.
- Generate a level from a seed.
