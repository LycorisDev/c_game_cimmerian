- Textures for walls, ceiling and floor.

- Minimap.
- Rotate with the mouse.
- Animated sprite.
- Door which can open and close (opportunity to use alpha blending).

- Use the height value for something: jump. It makes the walls higher or lower 
than the middle of the screen. Use a height value of 0 for the default look of 
the game. Have a vertical jump if no direction is pressed, otherwise go in the 
direction in question. But be careful not to bypass collisions. Jumping can be 
useful to avoid an enemy's attack, or to jump across toxic water, or even to 
jump on a moving platform.
