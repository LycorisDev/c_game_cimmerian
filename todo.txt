Diffs between the GL and MLX versions:
- The MLX version doesn't use the key pad arrows.
- The MLX version doesn't have fullscreen mode, only big or smaller res.
- The MLX version has a slower mouse-based rotation.

---

- Load a level from a file. Maybe something like Grim Fetcher, with a folder 
containing numbered levels. Make it so that the level exits either to another 
map if it exists, or otherwise to the victory message.

- Indicate sprite positions in the map file, instead of harcoding them. Make it 
a list of vec2 values under each sprite name.

---

- Collision with a decor sprite.
- Collectible sprite. Collect souls to open the exit door, because why not. 
There's not much of a gameplay, I want to quickly finish it.

- The enemy is displayed on the minimap.
- The enemy is visible beyond the dark veil.
- Pathfinding for the enemy.

---

- Fade out effect from game to game over screen.

- Sound.
- Main menu, at least for sound options (silence / volume). The menu is a game 
state (t_man->game_state == GAME_STATE_PAUSE).
- Should I add sound (and therefore a menu) to Grim Fetcher?

- Besides loading a level from a file, have the option of generating a level 
from a seed.
