Notes:
- The minimum window size is 128x128 while the maximum is the monitor size.
- Use a value inferior or equal to 0.1 as the aspect ratio to express "whatever 
the monitor's aspect ratio is". For example 0 or -1.
- The skybox image is meant to have a size of (res.x * 4, res.y). If this is 
not respected, the skybox isn't displayed properly.
- The GUI had been made with a resolution of (640, 360), and isn't adapted to 
other resolutions. It respects the aspect ratio, however.

[DEFAULT MAP]

NSEW: Player start position
D: Door (simple door)
G: Goal (victory)
P: Portal (to another map)
0: Ground
1-9: Type of ordinary walls
Whitespace: Empty space

[CEIL-FLOOR MAP]

0-9: Pair of ceiling and floor textures (null is possible)
Whitespace: Null for sure

[PORTAL DETAIL]

P N X, Y path_to_dest_map
P N X, Y path_to_dest_map N X, Y

-> First cardinal: the face of the cell used as portal.
-> First XY (int): the location of the portal cell in the current map.
-> String: the file path to the destination map (can be current).
	If the name is literally "null", this leads to a dummy map meant to trigger 
	a game over.
-> [Optional] The destination's cardinal direction + new pos XY (int).
The new pos can be the location of another portal, it's safe.
If not indicated, the map's default start pos and direction will be used.
