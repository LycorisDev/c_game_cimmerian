- Use the height value for something: jump. It makes the walls higher or lower 
than the middle of the screen. Use a height value of 0 for the default look of 
the game. Have a vertical jump if no direction is pressed, otherwise go in the 
direction in question. But be careful not to bypass collisions. Jumping can be 
useful to avoid an enemy's attack, or to jump across toxic water, or even to 
jump on a moving platform. Of course, if I can jump, I can crawl as well.
- Sound.
- Enter a seed to generate a level, or maybe you can send a map file. Support 
for both?
