- Fix sprite showing through doors.
- Animated sprite.

- The goal is to reach a tall monolith. It can cycle through different colors 
or even have an animated texture.
- Once you're done with the raycasting, have indoor rooms have a ceiling, while 
everything else has the skybox. Also, use a grass tile outside, or even 
different tiles, some dirt, some grass, and a blend of the two, like in 2D 
games. Indoors, you can have the checkered pattern.

- Use a colored glass or something to showcase transparency. Maybe an enemy.
- Rotate with the mouse.
- Minimap.

- Place doors in the middle of the cell.
- Sound.
- Enter a seed to generate a level, or maybe you can send a map file. Support 
for both?
