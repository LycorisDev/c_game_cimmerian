Diffs between the GL and MLX versions:
- The MLX version doesn't use the key pad arrows.
- The MLX version doesn't have fullscreen mode, only big or smaller res.
- The MLX version has a slower mouse-based rotation.

- Enter the portal and see from within + Fade out effect + Fade in effect to 
another map or a victory message.

- Collision with a decor sprite.
- Collectible sprite.

- The enemy is displayed on the minimap.
- The enemy is visible beyond the dark veil.

- Sound.
- Main menu, at least for sound options (silence / volume).
- Should I add sound (and therefore a menu) to Grim Fetcher?

- Load a level from a file. Maybe something like Grim Fetcher, with a folder 
containing numbered levels.
- Generate a level from a seed.
