I need a system where both doors are portals are handled the same way:
- They can be at any offset within the cell.
- They have a different texture depending on whether they are open or closed.
- They can be opened, and maybe even closed, based on distance.
- They can be opened, and maybe even closed, on the press of a button or 
sequence of buttons.
- They can be opened, and maybe even closed, through the use of an item. And 
maybe different sets of items, for example the correct key, or with a crowbar.

The difference between a door and a portal, is that a door is simply a wall 
which loses collision when open. A portal teleports you to another location on 
collision, whether within the same map or another. Also, portals are of two 
different types: teleporters and corridors. Both actually teleport you, but the 
corridor type looks like you're simply walking into the map, and only the 
minimap shows you that teleportation happened.

Do I add a portal gun?
