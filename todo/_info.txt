Notes:
- The minimum window size is 128x128 while the maximum is the monitor size.
- Use a value inferior or equal to 0.1 as the aspect ratio to express "whatever 
the monitor's aspect ratio is". For example 0 or -1.
- The skybox image is meant to have a size of (res.x * 4, res.y). If this is 
not respected, the skybox isn't displayed properly.
- The GUI had been made with a resolution of (640, 360), and isn't adapted to 
other resolutions. It respects the aspect ratio, however.
