COMMON
- OpenAL: Loop source with multithreading.
- The option to have a (flat) sprite not facing the camera, but a specific 
direction.
- If the skybox is an animation which changes color, the fog color needs to 
change as well. The image average color is actually an array, make use of this 
instead of only using the first array element.

[COMMON] SOUND
- Consider sound effects. For example when collecting something (one sound for 
all collectibles). Also a jingle when reaching the winning screen, and a damage 
sound effect when reaching the losing screen. I don't want a sound when 
crossing a portal, as certain portals ought to be discreet. In any case, don't 
have these tracks be indicated in a hardcoded manner. They are indicated in the 
map file. They are their own line. For example, "M_COLLEC", "M_WIN", "M_LOSE", 
and the simple "M" becomes "M_BG". This could be the "M" of MP3, instead of 
using "T" for "track" which could remind of "texture".
- Consider several "music tracks", in the sense as something looping in the 
background. Each soundtrack is indicated with the "M" var in the map file. For 
the time being, the parsing only allow one music track. The purpose of another 
one is for example to have ambient sound, such as the wind. Something I have to 
make clear to future me: DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT... Try to determine whether 
the player is indoors or outdoors, this is more complex than you imagine. Let 
the map designer make their own decisions. It's not complicated for them to 
have a map with only the outside of buildings, no way to get inside them 
besides a portal for the door, and then a smaller map for the inside of the 
building. The "inside" map could encompass all the buildings of a map, the 
designer doesn't have to create a new map for each building. This way, the 
sound fits. And if you wonder how such a map can be written when "islands" 
are not allowed, remember that a space can be used to represent a literal empty 
cell, and the walkable areas are still enclosed in walls because they are 
the inner part of buildings, aka they have walls. What's not allowed is a mere 
newline.

[COMMON] COLLECTIBLES
- Have a general icon for collectibles: a small circle using the same pattern 
as the goal texture (switching between these two specific colors).
- It shows the amount of collectibles we already have as well as the amount 
needed to win the game, hardcoded as 5.
- When entering a map with collectibles in it, these are showcased right under 
the general collectible line. The icon of the map collectible is shown, with 
how many have been found and how many are available. For example, in the AFG 
map, each book is a single line, because they are different collectibles, and 
not several instances of the same one.
- Let's allow the player to collect them all, but with a boolean switch in the 
macro header. Depending on the boolean value, which is hardcoded, the player 
can keep collecting even if it's to have more collectibles than needed, 
otherwise the player cannot collect anymore.

[BONUS] LEVELS - SELECT SCREEN
- Instead of giving a map file as argument, you can give a directory. The game 
fetches all the map files present there, recursively. If only one map exists, 
it's loaded automatically. Otherwise, a select screen shows up. It lists the 
maps as they came in, with the name being their filename without the extension. 
You can select any of them.
- For the name being displayed, it's actually not just the filename. It's the 
path starting after the folder, and without "*.map" at the end. For example, 
for "maps/bonus" as argument, it's "OLAFUR/AFG" and "TEST/DGN".
- When you press BACKSPACE, you're brought back to this menu. If there was only 
one map (which is also the case if you indicated a map and not a directory), 
then you're brought back there automatically instead of selecting. Besides 
pressing BACKSPACE, also have an explicit menu option.
