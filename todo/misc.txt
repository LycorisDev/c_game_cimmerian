- Currently, the "JSON" lines within the map files aren't used, and all the 
JSON files are loaded from the main function. Later on, they will load 
individually at map-parsing time.
- Before this can happen, the parsing needs to read the entire map file, 
otherwise this conflicts with the GNL of the JSON parsing. It's also the sane 
way of parsing anyway.
