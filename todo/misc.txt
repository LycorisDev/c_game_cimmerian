CURSOR
- Make the SUA and OpenGL cursors behave the same. Test going in and out of 
fullscreen. I've noticed that if you left click in GL while leaving the window, 
the cursor will remain in left click mode when you re-enter. The thing is that, 
in order to be like the SUA version, you cannot just set the left and right 
click actions to false when the cursor exits the window. If you do that, then 
you lose the ability to keep rotating with the right click, if you exit while 
still clicking and then go back. The SUA version has this continuity: the 
rotation stops if the cursor is not within the window, but if it re-enters then 
there's no need to stop clicking and then reclick, because the right-click 
action is still ongoing.

MENU - COMMANDS
- List the commands.
- Do we care about allowing people to change the keys? Check on the old Windows 
PC what happens with WASD. Are the physical keys used, or the value keys? We 
might have to be able to ask for physical keys, and then we tell the user to 
use WASD or ZQSD. I won't bother with a French translation though. Just the 
keys, maybe.

MENU - SOUND
- Be able to mute only the music.
- Be able to mute only the ambiance.
- Be able to mute only the sound effects.
- Be able to mute everything.
- Control the volume as well.

MENU - SELECT LEVEL
- Instead of giving a map file as argument, you can give a directory. The game 
fetches all the map files present there, recursively. If only one map exists, 
it's loaded automatically. Otherwise, a select screen shows up. It lists the 
maps as they came in, with the name being their filename without the extension. 
You can select any of them. For the name being displayed, it's actually not 
just the filename. It's the path starting after the folder, and without "*.map" 
at the end. For example, for "assets/maps/" as argument, it's "OLAFUR/AFG" and 
"TEST/DGN".
- Remove the BACKSPACE shortcut, and use the menu instead, accessible from 
pressing ESCAPE. It allows you to pick another level, to reset your current 
level (destroy the map and load it again but without calling `add_map`, call 
`create_map` directly - create a function to reset a map and store it where it 
was in the man->maps array, and if it didn't work then remove this array elem 
from the array), or to reset your transform in this level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MISCELLANEOUS
- Add a decoration texture to a wall. It's a texture on top of the wall 
texture. You can use it in the pool map, for the legs and the ladder (place the 
ladder on the "stairs" wall).
- Can the door have an offset? Not in the center necessarily, but be on a 
specific cardinal face? And be seen on both side? For example in the "afg" map, 
I would like the doors to be on the outside of buildings, and to still be seen 
when we are within a building.
- I'd be nice if we could see the back textures of a transparent cell, for 
example the chicken stall in afg. I know I've failed once, but damn, that'd be 
nice. But be mindful of the case where there's another cell right behind this 
one. You would show the back tex of A in front of the front tex of B. To test 
this, place an opaque cell right behind a stall cell.
- Fix the weird jagged rendering when a wall is taller than 1.0 height.
- Upgrade the sprites to be like in Doom, where a different frame is shown 
depending on the angle. The sprite has a direction, it still always faces the 
camera, but its angle relative to the camera is relevant to know which frame to 
use. For example, if it has four different frames, this means it has a front, a 
back, a right side and a left side. Of course, if it has only one frame, it's 
always shown no matter the angle.
- Continue raycasting through portals, both as a corridor and as an Aperture 
Science's portal.

TECHNICAL
- The ability to look up and down. Use the mouse for that: we already could 
rotate horizontally with the mouse (as well as with keys), now the mouse is 
also responsible for the vertical rotation. For the horizontal mouse rotation, 
it's truly a rotation, the whole player body rotates, it's not just their POV, 
otherwise this would require them to use the rotation keys as well during 
action packed gameplay, and it would be too much, it wouldn't be fun. It's 
easier for them (and for them) to make the whole body rotate. The vertical 
mouse rotation however is just the point of view. (unsure: If we had 
multiplayer or a mirror to see the player character, I would like their head to 
follow the vertical movement.)
- Jump and crouch.
- The ability to fall and see the world go higher and higher until our field of 
view fades to black. Basically, make holes.
- The ability to swim when in water.
- The ability to fly?
- Is it possible to improve the skybox? And about the skybox, can we have 
different layers? Like, the background, and then another for the clouds, which 
slowly move even if we stand still?
- The ability to cast a spell, such as a fireball. You aim with the right click 
and there's crosshair in the middle of the window when you're in "right-click" 
mode.
- Can you climb up and down stairs? What about ladders? Can you fall down a 
pipe as you look down towards the "ground", until the ground is reached, and 
you can look up into the pipe?

GAMEPLAY
- Do we do this thing where reaching the goal can bring us to another level, 
and if there's no more level then it's victory? I know I already have portals, 
but it's not just about reaching another level, through not overriding its 
start point. It's about doing this Doom thing where we see the conclusion of 
the level: the items we collected, how long we took, and whatever honorable 
mentions we could think of. I don't know.
- Have a general icon for collectibles: a small circle using the same pattern 
as the goal texture (switching between these two specific colors).
- When entering a map with collectibles in it, these are showcased right under 
the general collectible line. The icon of the map collectible is shown, with 
how many have been found and how many are available. For example, in Olafur's 
afg map, each book is a single line, because they are different collectibles, 
and not several instances of the same one.
- A life bar, and losing life when hitting a trap, and recovering life when 
picking up a healing item.
- An inventory system. You no longer automatically consume the item on pickup.
- The ability to drop an item to the ground (without destroying it, so it can 
be picked up again).
- Certain doors and portals don't open and close on distance, they require an 
interaction. It's simply the hit of the Enter key once close enough to the 
target. Ponder over whether this is useful for a door/portal to have their ways 
of opening and closing be different.
- Certain doors require certain items: could be a specific key for this 
specific door. Also a crowbar or whatever, to break it open if we don't have a 
key, but not all doors can be broken open this way.
- Seeing which item we have equipped in our hand, with an animation when using 
it, for example hitting the door with a crowbar.
- Ooooh... Lockpicking? I love the lockpicking in Skyrim.
- You pick up ammo, which is just mana.
- An enemy to fight.
- If we want different "weapons", we could just have different types of mana, 
which is like different kinds of ammo, and the weapon might be a magic item to 
allow us to cast. This way, it's like having different guns and their 
respective ammo. Anyway, enemies can give us mana when defeated, and the type 
of mana they give depends on which enemy it is. They could give none if they're 
not organic, otherwise they give the default kind of mana, it's the neutral 
mana. It's like the spectrum of light, this mana would be "white". Then, 
certain enemies give a specific kind of mana (fire, ice... Or is it: 
movement/speed, and stillness?). You can find a station to separate your 
neutral mana into different kinds, or to combine special kinds to obtain 
neutral (difficult, as you would need all the different kinds to obtain 
neutral).
